Your current implementation already optimizes video delivery using HTTP range requests, which allow the client to request specific chunks of the video, facilitating faster streaming and allowing the user to start watching before the entire video is downloaded.

Here are a few additional ideas you can consider to make the video load even faster:

### 1. **Video Compression and Optimization:**
   - Use a tool like `ffmpeg` to compress and optimize your videos for web delivery. Ensure the bitrate, resolution, and format are suitable for fast streaming. For example:
     ```bash
     ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -crf 28 -preset fast output.mp4
     ```
     - **CRF value**: The Constant Rate Factor controls the compression level. Lower values produce better quality but larger files.
     - **Preset**: The `preset fast` provides a good balance between encoding speed and compression efficiency.

### 2. **Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN):**
   - Hosting your video on a CDN allows it to be cached and served from multiple servers closer to the user, significantly reducing the load time for clients in different locations.

### 3. **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (HLS or DASH):**
   - Instead of serving the whole video as a single file, consider using **HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)** or **Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH)**. These protocols break the video into smaller chunks and adapt the bitrate dynamically based on the user’s bandwidth, making the video stream more efficient. You can use `ffmpeg` to create HLS files:
     ```bash
     ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -codec: copy -start_number 0 -hls_time 10 -hls_list_size 0 -f hls output.m3u8
     ```
     This creates an `.m3u8` file with video chunks that can be streamed more efficiently.

### 4. **Leverage HTTP/2 or HTTP/3:**
   - Ensure your server supports **HTTP/2** or **HTTP/3**, which can improve loading speeds by reducing latency, enabling multiplexing, and better utilizing network resources.

### 5. **Preload the Video:**
   - If your goal is to load the video faster, you can use the `preload` attribute on the `<video>` element to preload metadata or the entire video, depending on the user’s bandwidth. Although you already use `loading="lazy"`, the `preload` option could be added depending on your specific needs:
     ```html
     <video controls preload="auto">
         <source src="/video" type="video/mp4" />
         Your browser does not support the video tag.
     </video>
     ```

### 6. **Caching More Aggressively:**
   - You're already setting cache headers, but you might want to adjust the cache duration depending on your use case. For example, you could also implement **ETag** headers for cache validation to ensure the video isn't unnecessarily re-downloaded if it hasn't changed.

### 7. **Gzip or Brotli Compression:**
   - Enable Gzip or Brotli compression for faster delivery of video metadata and other associated files. While videos themselves are usually not compressed with these, it can help for other static assets like HTML or CSS files.

### 8. **Lazy Loading or Intersection Observer:**
   - If you're loading multiple videos on a single page, lazy load them using the Intersection Observer API, so only the videos in view are fetched, optimizing bandwidth usage and page performance.

In conclusion, combining the optimizations you’ve already implemented with **adaptive streaming**, **video compression**, **CDN usage**, and **HTTP/2/3** can significantly improve the video loading experience. Let me know if you want to dive deeper into any of these options!
