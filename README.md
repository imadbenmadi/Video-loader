Video Compression and Optimization:
â€¢	Use a tool like ffmpeg to compress and optimize your videos for web delivery. Ensure the bitrate, resolution, and format are suitable for fast streaming. For example:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -crf 28 -preset fast output.mp4
o	CRF value: The Constant Rate Factor controls the compression level. Lower values produce better quality but larger files.
o	Preset: The preset fast provides a good balance between encoding speed and compression efficiency.
